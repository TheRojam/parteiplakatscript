# parteiplakatscript
Script for generating Posters for the German Political Party 'DiePARTEI'
Background images can be used by placing a png file in the same Directory as the script an naming them 'hintergrund.png'
the template 'hintergrund.png' should not be deleted bacause inkscape prints an error in the final images if theres no such file
the data file is a plain svg file an can be edited with a texteditor
